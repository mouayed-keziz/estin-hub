# CPRJ : ESTIN HUB

#### Project description :<br/>

The project involves developing a dedicated web platform for non-academic communication within our school. This platform will serve as a community hub where students can share experiences, helpful tips, and where teachers can disseminate research materials. Additionally, it will facilitate the sharing of information about club activities and provide a space to report lost and found items. The goal is to reduce clutter in students' inboxes by shifting non-academic communication to this platform.
